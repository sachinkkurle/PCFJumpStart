#logging:

Lombok dependency has been added to the project, so we can use @Slf4j annotation and add logging.

There are 5 levels of logs based on usage

Trace
Debug
Info
Warn
Error
These are in the order of low to high priority. Default log level is info, so the logs of info and higher only will get logged.

This log level can be modified by the below property in the yml file, logging: level: root: warn

========================================================================== 

If you want to find the details for each request, open zipkin dashboard and find the trace details
