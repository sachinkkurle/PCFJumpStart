# Zipkin-Server

Create a simple zipkin-server which provides the dashboard for tracing the traces and spans for our request.

Build and Run the application, it runs on localhost:9411
We can access zipkin dashboard with that URL.

Now start the student application (checkif it has zipkin dependency) and hit its endpoints.

Then open the zipkin dashboard and click on find traces, then you will find all the requests that you have given.
Open each trace and find more details about each reqeust.
